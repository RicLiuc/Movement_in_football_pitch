# External Element

These modules allow the project to construct the external element used in the OST-ResNet.

The data used in this module are provided by WyScout (https://wyscout.com). Between the several dataset provided by WyScout we take advantage of the event dataset.

- External.py: this module extracts the external atributes directly from the SkillCorner dataset.
- Extract_advanced_external.py: this module extract and merge the event data from the WyScout dataset.
